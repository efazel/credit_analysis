# Credit Risk Modeling (ongoing project - incomplete)
This repository performs credit risk analysis to model the probability of default. The project consists of multiple stages. In the first stage, preprocessing, I prepare discrete and continuous data to be used later in the PD model. 
## Data
The loan dataset is available in Kaggle. Click [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mrferozi/loan-data-for-dummy-bank) for more information.
## Methodology
The methodology of this exercise follows closely the one presented in [Credit Risk Modeling in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-risk-modeling-in-python/) available in Udemy.
