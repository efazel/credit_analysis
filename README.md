# Credit Analysis (ongoing project - not complete)
This repository performs credit risk analysis to model probability of default. The project consists of multiple stages. In the first stage, preprocessing, I prepare discrete and continuous data to be used later in the PD model. 

This methodology of this exercise follows closely the oen presented in the [Credit Risk Modeling in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/credit-risk-modeling-in-python/) available in Udemy.
